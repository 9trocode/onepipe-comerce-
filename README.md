Heroku is a cloud-based development platform as a service (PaaS) provider â€“ a new way of building and deploying web apps. Our service lets app developers spend their time on their application code, not managing servers, deployment, ongoing operations, or scaling. Heroku provides the tools and services you need to build and deploy customer-facing applications without having to worry about infrastructure.

WordPress is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. This is a free and open-source blogging tool and a content management system (CMS) based on PHP and MySQL.

You can deploy your own version of WordPress on Heroku in seconds using the Heroku button below:
